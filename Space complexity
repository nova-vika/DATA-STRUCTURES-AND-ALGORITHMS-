SPACE COMPLEXITY :

   1. Space complexity tells us how much extra memory an algoorithm uses when the input size increases .

 >>>>> Common Space Complexities :

    1. o(1) - constant space 

         ..>>  memory does not increase with input size .


         case 1: ONE PIECE OF PAPER

             Imagine you are counting students.

             You use ONE paper and write just the total number.

              5 students → still 1 paper

              100 students → still 1 paper

               You are NOT adding more papers.

          >>>>>>>>> Memory does NOT increase

          >>>>>>>>> This is called O(1) space
(meaning: constant space)


         case 2: MANY PIECES OF PAPER

              Now imagine you write each student’s name on a paper.

              5 students → 5 papers

              100 students → 100 papers

               As students increase, papers increase.
  
        >>>>>>>>> Memory increases

        >>>>>>>>> This is called O(n) space


>>>>Why Space Complexity is Important

     * To know how much memory an algorithm needs

     * To avoid programs that use too much memory

     *To compare two solutions based on memory usage
